## Motivation
During my last year of college, I worked on a UX project to address a user's needs and creating design requirements for a potential product. What I (and many others) struggle with is **finding the right gift for someone** and **remembering major/minor things about people**. For the project, I needed to address user needs of having a low stress, easy to access way to accomplish these things. [(more about that project here)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dWq5GJjx4928IoYPuags-LzF1mkK41XEh3JFEf4TkZE/edit?usp=sharing)

I wanted to turn this into a ***PERSONAL PROJECT*** because I felt like I could use an app that could allow me to keep notes about my friends and recommend meaningful gifts that I could give to them. My goal was to make a simple version of this idea from my UX project. I also wanted to touch up on my React/Next skills and learn a new relational database tool.
